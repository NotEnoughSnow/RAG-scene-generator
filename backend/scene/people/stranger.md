Name: Unknown

Physical Appearance: Hooded figure curled inward like a wounded animal. Slender hands with dirt-caked nails grip a goblet. A faint herbal scent clings to their robes.

Attire: Coarse-spun gray cloak, threadbare at the hem. Mud-caked boots show recent travel through wetlands. The goblet's silver bears elven runes filed nearly smooth.

Current Actions: Hunched low over the table, left index finger tracing the tapestry's unraveling threads. Shoulders tremble slightly with each whispered phrase in a guttural tongue.

History: Appeared three nights ago during the thunder moon, paying with ancient coins bearing the sigil of fallen Elderglen.

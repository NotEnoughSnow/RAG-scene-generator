Behind the bar stands the [barkeeper](people/barkeeper.md), wiping a stained tankard with a ragged cloth. His broad shoulders slope beneath a simple leather apron, and his eyes flick through the room, noting debts yet unpaid. He hums a low tune, leaning forward to slide a fresh mug of ale toward an unseen patron.

At the first long table, the [mercenary](people/mercenary.md) sits with one boot propped on a bench, scarred gauntlet resting on the wood. His helm lies beside him, dented and scuffed; he fingers its rim as he listens to the crackle of the hearth. He mutters a dry observation about the stew’s saltiness, voice rough as gravel.

Opposite him, the [rogue](people/rogue.md) perches on a stool, cloak’s hood thrown back to reveal a wide grin. Fingers drum on the table’s edge, playing a silent rhythm. She glances side to side, eyes alight as she slides a coin across to an accomplice hidden in the shadow of the [lantern cluster](props/lantern_cluster.md).

By the hearth, the [bard](people/bard.md) leans against the stone, lute balanced on his knee. He strums a soft melody, each note rising through the curling smoke. His dusty coat drapes over his shoulders like spilled ink; between verses, he tosses a quick wink to the [paladin](people/paladin.md) watching from the corner.

Guarding the corridor’s arch, the [paladin](people/paladin.md) stands with feet planted and sword hilt gripped in both hands. His breastplate bears faint scorch marks, and he surveys the room with steady intensity. He offers a whispered prayer under his breath, lips moving in a silent rhythm.

In the dim corner near the [tapestry](props/tapestry.md), a [cloaked stranger](people/stranger.md) sits hunched, face concealed beneath shadow. One pale hand grips a chipped goblet while the other traces the tapestry’s edge. Occasionally, they murmur a phrase in a tongue none here recognize, voice soft and urgent.

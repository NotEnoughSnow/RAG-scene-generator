Sunlight slants in through narrow windows high on the south wall, illuminating a rectangular room seventy feet across and forty feet deep. The flagstone floor wears a gentle slope toward the bar area, encouraging wayward feet to gravitate there. Rough timbers support a low ceiling streaked with smoke, each beam bearing faint grooves and discolorations from countless years of use. Solid walls of whitewashed stone rise to meet stout wooden rafters bound by iron bands.

At the western end, a [wooden door](props/wooden_door.md) swings upon iron hinges, its surface ringed with dents and reinforced by horizontal planks. Stepping past it, you sense the ambient hush shift to the low murmur of voices and the scrape of stools.

The southern wall is dominated by the [oak bar](props/oak_bar.md). Its counter gleams unevenly where hands have worn the polish away, revealing the soft grain beneath. Stools ring its front in irregular intervals, their legs set into the flagstones. Behind this span of wood, storage shelves carved into the stone hold an array of empty bottles shadowed by the bar’s overhang. A subtle scent of spilled ale and aging oak drifts from its edge.

Center stage occupy two parallel rows of [long tables](props/long_table.md). Each table is pocked and scratched, one marked by a deep gouge where a blade once struck. Four benches hug both sides of each table, seats hollowed by decades of patrons. Crumbs of stale bread and the occasional splatter of ale cling to their crevices. Overhead, the lanterns’ honeyed glow stacks upon soft lamplit warmth.

Suspended from iron hooks in the ceiling’s center, a dense [lantern cluster](props/lantern_cluster.md) bathes the room in wavering light. The glow pools in circles on the floor and chases shadows up the walls. Smoke threads through the lanterns, softening their edges and lending the light a honeyed haze.

In the northeast corner, a broad [hearth](props/hearth.md) dominates. Its iron grate cradles glowing coals beneath a cast-iron pot that simmers with stew. The air around it carries the rich aroma of onion stew, mingled with the faint crackle of embers.

Against the eastern wall hangs a moth-eaten [tapestry](props/tapestry.md). Its threads are faded but still trace an ancient battle scene: knights arrayed beneath banners, their faces lost to time. The fabric’s edges fray where soot-laden air has brushed against it, leaving a muted halo of gray around its frame.

Every inch of this main room speaks of use and history. From the soft echo of footsteps on the stones to the soot-stained panels above your head, no surface remains untouched by the passage of countless nights.

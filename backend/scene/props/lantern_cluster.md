Configuration
Seven lanterns suspended from a hexagonal iron frame (5 ft wide) by rusted chains. Three lanterns burn tallow candles (smoking), four burn fish oil (flickering blue).

Light Distribution
Casting overlapping circles of light on the floor, brightest beneath the central lantern (12-inch diameter pool), fading to gloom at the periphery. Shadows leap up the walls when smoke swirls.

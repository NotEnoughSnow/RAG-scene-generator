# Physical Composition
Constructed from aged oak planks, each 8 inches wide and 2 inches thick, bound by three horizontal iron reinforcement bands. The wood bears deep gouges radiating from a central impact point, suggesting repeated blunt-force trauma. Iron strap hinges, each 18 inches long, anchor the door to a stone frame. A crude iron latch mechanism sits at waist height.

# Current State
Slightly ajar, allowing a 4-inch gap revealing slivers of the muddy street outside. Faint daylight highlights dust motes swirling in the gap. Dried mud cakes the lower 10 inches, flaking where boots have scraped it. One hinge squeaks rhythmically with the door's subtle sway.

# Surface Details
Thirty-seven distinct dent clusters mar the surface, concentrated near the latch. Faded chalk marks—a tally system—appear beside the handle. Sap weeps from a crack in the uppermost plank, crystallizing into amber droplets. Nail heads protrude unevenly, rust streaking downward like tear trails.

Faded wool threads depict:
- Twelve knights on horseback charging leftward
- A castle with one collapsed tower (upper right)
- Arrow clusters frozen mid-air
- Heraldry: A silver boar on black (repeated 8 times)

# Damage

- Moth holes: 37 concentrated near the lower border
- Fraying: Threads unspooling along the left edge
- Stains: Ale splash marks on the right corner
- Soot gradient: Darkest at the top, fading downward

# Hanging Mechanism
Oak dowel threaded through a sleeve, ends resting on iron wall hooks. Lower right corner curls inward, revealing a patch of whitewashed stone behind.

# Construction
Fieldstone arch spanning 8 feet wide, 4 feet high. Iron grate holds 37 glowing oak embers beneath a cast-iron cauldron (24-inch diameter).

# Active Elements

- Cauldron bubbles: slow blorps releasing onion-scented steam

- Ember arrangement: densest at the center, fading to ash at edges

- Hearth tools: Soot-caked poker leaning against right jamb

# Soot Patterns
Black velvet soot coats the upper arch, thinning near the mantel where a woodpecker skull rests. Creosote streaks weep downward from mortar joints.

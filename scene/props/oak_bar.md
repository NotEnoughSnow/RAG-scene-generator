# Structure
A single 22-foot slab of quarter-sawn oak, 4 inches thick, supported by twelve barrel-stave legs mortised into the flagstones. The front face features carved sigils: a tilted mug (left), crossed spoons (center), and a broken lute (right).

# Wear Patterns
The countertopâ€™s lacquer has eroded into a topographical map of stains: circular ale rings near serving positions, sticky syrup patches by the fruit bowl, and a comet-shaped scorch mark from a dropped pipe. Patina glows amber under lantern light where elbows rest, contrasting with matte, unpolished sections.

# Contents
Behind the bar:
- Three rows of inverted tankards dangling from hooks
- A dented tin basin filled with murky rinse water
- A ledger book splayed open, revealing smudged charcoal tallies
- A wedge of mold-speckled cheese beneath a wire dome

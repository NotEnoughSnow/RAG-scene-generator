# Material & Damage
Butcher-block maple, 14 feet long, scarred by:
- A 3-inch-deep axe gash near the northeast corner
- Twenty-seven knife-carved initials clustered at the center
- Candle wax stalagmites (red, white, black) along the edges

# Seating Arrangement
Eighteen-inch-wide benches flank the table, their oak seats worn concave by generations of patrons. Straw stuffing erupts from split seams. One bench leg splintered recently, shored up with a rusted sword scabbard.
- Current Debris
- Crust of brown bread fragments
- Ale puddle seeping into woodgrain veins
- Two chicken bones crossed in an 'X'
- Tarnished copper coin glued to the surface by dried mead

Name: Sil

Physical Appearance: A wiry woman no taller than five feet, with sun-bleached brown braids escaping her hood. A lattice of faint white scars covers her forearms like pale ivy.

Attire: Moth-eaten green cloak over patched deerskin trousers. Seven knives hang concealed beneath her clothes, their sheaths worn smooth against her ribs.

Current Actions: Perched on the stool's edge, weight forward on the balls of her feet. Her right hand slides a copper crown across wood grain while her left taps a nervous rhythm against her thigh. Eyes flicker between the paladin and the shadowed accomplice.

History: Orphaned by bandits, grew up picking pockets in Lyreguard markets. The scar network came from a noble's hounds during her last escape.

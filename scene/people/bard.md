Name: Arion

Physical Appearance: Lanky frame of twenty-five years, with ink-stained fingers and a chipped front tooth. Fever-bright blue eyes contrast with his soot-smudged cheeks.

Attire: Faded crimson doublet missing three buttons. Lute straps cross his chest like bandoliers. One boot sole flaps loose where the stitching has failed.

Current Actions: Lute propped on his bent knee, calloused fingers stumbling through a ballad. His free hand stirs stew-scented air as he mouths lyrics. Sweat beads on his forehead from the hearth's heat.

History: Disgraced choirboy who fled the Cathedral of Stars after a forbidden affair. His lute bears a bishop's sigil scraped raw from its surface.

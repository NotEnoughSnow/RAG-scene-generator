Name: Ser Ryam

Physical Appearance: Broad-shouldered man in his forties, standing rigid as an oak post. A burn scar crawls up his neck like a crimson vine. Short-cropped hair reveals a skull dent above his left ear.

Attire: Tarnished silver breastplate over a sweat-darkened gambeson. A two-handed greatsword stands point-down between his feet, its leather grip shiny from devotion.

Current Actions: Hands locked on the sword's pommel, thumb rubbing a worn prayer groove. Eyes sweep the room in slow arcs, lingering on the stranger's hood. Lips move silently in the Litany of Vigilance.

History: Sole survivor of the Bleakfen Massacre, where his order fell to swamp fiends. The burn came from a creature's acid breath.

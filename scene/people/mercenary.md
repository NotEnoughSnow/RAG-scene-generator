Name: Kaelen the Cut

Physical Appearance: A lean man of thirty summers, face weathered like saddle leather. A fresh scar bisects his right eyebrow, pulling the lid into a permanent half-squint. Iron-gray eyes hold no warmth.

Attire: Rust-spotted chainmail under a tabard bearing a faded boar sigil. Fingerless gloves reveal knuckles tattooed with prison dots. A notched longsword leans against his bench within instant reach.

Current Actions: Boot heel grinding a breadcrumb into the table's gouge mark. His left hand rotates an empty mug while the right fingers his helm's deepest dent. Nostrils flare as he scowls toward the hearth.

History: Expelled from the Duke's guard for excessive brutality. Now hires his sword to merchants crossing the haunted Wolfswood.

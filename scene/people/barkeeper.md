Name: Borin Stonehand

Physical Appearance: A thick-necked man in his late fifties, standing six feet tall with shoulders rounded from decades of barrel-lifting. His left ear shows a crescent-shaped scar where a tankard struck him years ago. Coarse gray hair, cropped short, frames a face reddened by hearth heat and ale fumes.

Attire: A leather apron stained with dried mead streaks over a rough-spun tunic. The apron's ties bite into his waist, revealing where the fabric has stretched around his middle. Copper rings adorn three fingers, their surfaces dulled by grease.

Current Actions: Leaning forward with both palms flat on the bar, knuckles white from pressure. His eyes track the rogue's coin-slipping maneuver while pretending to polish a smudged tankard. A tendon flexes in his jaw as he calculates unpaid tabs.

History: Former caravan guard who took over the tavern after an arrow lamed his knee. Still keeps a cudgel beneath the bar, its handle worn smooth by his grip.
